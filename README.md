SubSixDegrees is inspired by the classic games Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon and Wiki Racing. The goal was to create a fun and unconventional way for players to explore Reddit, linking subreddits through posts, comments, and user interactions. Much like Six Degrees connects actors to Kevin Bacon through movies, SubSixDegrees uses the vast web of Reddit content to create surprising, sometimes hilarious, connections between subreddits.

Check out the top bar to find where you're starting and where you need to go. Click through the subreddit descriptions, posts, comments, and users to try and find your way there. A red underline indicates you can navigate to it.

Once you win you can (optionally) choose to share your map to the post to show off to other players.
